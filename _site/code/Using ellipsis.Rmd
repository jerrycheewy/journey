```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Ever wondered what the three dots `...` is when you're keying in arguments to a function?

`...` is called the ellipsis, and is a handy way of passing additional arguments to a function without constraints on the length/order.

An immediate use-case for something like this is with the dplyr verbs.

We'll work with the `mtcars` dataset for a simple demonstration.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# Basic set up
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Remind ourselves of what mtcars dataset looks like
head(mtcars)
```

Traditional way of counting the number of observations: How many cars within each cylinder group? 
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% tally

```
What if we wanted the ability to do a count based on a varying set of dimensions?

Let's write function to do just that!
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
mycount <- function(x, ...){
  x %>% group_by(...) %>% tally
}
```

Now let's ask: How many transmission (`am`) type per gear type?
```{r,message=F, warning=F}
mycount(mtcars, gear, am)
```
Looks like 3-geared cars is the most populous and all of them being automatic (am = 0) cars!

We could easily ask different questions by dynamically passing the list of dimensions to the `group_by` within our `mycount` function.
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
mycount(mtcars, gear, carb, am)
mycount(mtcars, cyl, carb)
```

But what if we wanted to always specify the top level group by gear group?

Simple! Just pre-specify that group within your custom function and it will always be there *in addition* to the additional dimensions you provided via the `...`!
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
mycount_gear <- function(x, ...){
  x %>% group_by(gear, ...) %>% tally
}

#Notice that the result here is exactly the same as in 2 sections above.
mycount_gear(mtcars, am)
```
