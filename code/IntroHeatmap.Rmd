## Why visualise data in heatmaps?
There are often times where our data comes accompanied by descriptive attributes and we'd like to quickly 'look' at our data by summarising it across those attributes.

Referencing the asset management industry for context, a view **across sectors and geographies** is a typical first step of asessing how financial markets have moved (eg. returns, valuations) and where pockets of opportunities are.



## Getting started: Simulate financial market data

Let's create a sample dataset which perhaps simulates the returns across sectors and geographies. According to typical literature, asset returns are modelled to follow a normal distribution with a standard deviation and mean of what is historically observed for a globally diversified equity index.

```{r, message = F, warning  = F}
# Let's quickly load some standard R packages here so that you can follow this article. 
# If tidyverse is not yet installed, you may do so like such: > install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)

# Some sector and geographies for illustration
sector <- c("Technology","Consumer Discretionary", "Real Estate", "Financial Services")
geography <- c("Asia", "Europe", "US", "India")
# Simulate market returns based on a random normal distribution, with a mean return of 8% and volatility (standard deviation) 15%
returns <- data.frame(Returns = round(rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0.08, sd = 0.15), 2)) 

mydata <- cbind(Sector = sample(sector, 1000, replace = T), Geo = sample(geography, 1000, replace = T), returns)

head(mydata, 10)

```

A few things we'd like to ask our data:

1. What was the average return across sectors?
2. What was the average return across geographies?
3. Which sector + geography combination had the most movement?

The first 2 questions are easier to tackle on data tables because they single-dimension, but a heatmap would help visualise the answer much quicker.

## Summarising our data
```{r}

# Let's take a simple average across sector + geographies
myAvgRet <- mydata %>%
  group_by(Sector, Geo) %>%
  summarise(AVGreturns = mean(Returns))

# Summarised data in long-form
myAvgRet

```

## Heatmap plotting - Quick and dirty
The quickest way to plot without custom functions is to rely on `heatmap` from base R.
```{r}

# Convert to wide-form and move Sector names to rownames so that we can get a numeric matrix

myAvgRet.mat <- myAvgRet %>%
  # Convert long-form to wide-form
  spread(key = Geo, value = AVGreturns) %>%
  as.data.frame %>%
  # Extract column 'Sector' and use it to name rows. 
  # This is necessary so the final output is a numeric matrix, the input which the heatmap function takes
  column_to_rownames(var = "Sector") %>%
  as.matrix

# The matrix looks already like how we want to visualise it
myAvgRet.mat

# Notice how the column 'Sector' has become data captured as row names?
str(myAvgRet.mat)


# use base heatmap to plot
plot1 <- heatmap(myAvgRet.mat, Colv = NA, Rowv = NA, scale = "column")

```



That was fairly quick, wasn't it?

On second thoughts, however, to modify this heatmap to control for things like (A)**Colour palette**, (B)**Cell labels**, (C)**Colour Scale**, is possible but requires much [manipulation](https://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/heatmaps_in_r.html).


## Heatmap plotting - The **ggplot2** way

`ggplot` works only with the class dataframe, which is alright because that's the class which most of your datasets should be in given its flexibility to contain multiple classes of data within anyway.


Let's see what the most basic heatmap looks like in ggplot.
```{r}

library(ggplot2)

g1 <- ggplot(myAvgRet, aes(x = Sector, Geo)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = AVGreturns))
g1
```

That wasn't too bad, pretty close to the first method we saw above.

**Now let's add the labels.**

```{r}
ggplot(myAvgRet, aes(x = Sector, Geo)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = AVGreturns)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(AVGreturns, 3)))
```

What if we didn't like blue?
```{r}

ggplot(myAvgRet, aes(x = Sector, Geo)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = AVGreturns)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(AVGreturns, 3))) +
  # As our values are continuous, we'll use scale_fill_continuous instead of scale_fill_manual
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "violetred", high = "aquamarine")

```

### *Other tips and tricks*

There will be times where your data contains wildly skewed values and the automated colour fill will not work as well.

```{r, echo = F}
# Simulate wildly skewed values

myAvgRet.skewed <- myAvgRet
# Replace with extreme numbers
myAvgRet.skewed$AVGreturns[9:16] <- rnorm(8, 20, 10)

# Let's see how the heatmap looks like...
ggplot(myAvgRet.skewed, aes(x = Sector, Geo)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = AVGreturns)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(AVGreturns, 3))) +
  # As our values are continuous, we'll use scale_fill_continuous instead of scale_fill_manual
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "violetred", high = "aquamarine")

hist(myAvgRet.skewed$AVGreturns, breaks = 30)

```


Looking at the histogram of AVGreturns now, it's clear that we might need to fine-tune the colour breakdown for the 0-1 bucket, else it will get washed out with the values above 10.

In order to do this, we need to intervene by indicating our own intervals. To do this, we need to convert the numeric column AVGreturns into ordered factors, based on our discretion of the intervals.

```{r}
# Create a new variable which is a factorised version of AVGreturns
myAvgRet.skewed$AVGreturns.f <- cut(myAvgRet.skewed$AVGreturns,
                                    breaks = c(min(myAvgRet.skewed$AVGreturns), 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 10, 20, 30, max(myAvgRet.skewed$AVGreturns)),
                                    labels = c("<0%", "0-1%", "1%-3%", "3%-5%", "5%-10%", "10%-1000%", "1000%-2000%", "2000%-3000%", ">3000%"), include.lowest = T)

# Create plot based on the factorised column
ggplot(myAvgRet.skewed, aes(x = Sector, Geo)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = AVGreturns.f)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(AVGreturns, 3))) +
  # Given that factors have discrete levels, we need to use scale_fill_manual instead of scale_fill_continuous
  scale_fill_manual(values = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9, "PiYG")) # Use RColorBrewer for discrete categories
```
